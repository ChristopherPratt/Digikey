This C# Interface allows for viewing of 1 particular item, a transistor. 
When trying to search for a product the user is taken the filtering page. 
This page will show filtering options populated with some data directly from Digikey. 
The filtering ability itself is not completely functional but provides the visuals of
 what the new interface would convey to users. There is also a page to show cart, containing a static item,
 the transistor. The quantities on this page along with the product details will update the price in the cart page. 
The shipping and address pages display their options and applicable input fields, these pages will take data but 
there is no underlying function using the data. Lastly, the support page will display common support questions with
 hyperlinks that match those found on Digikey but do not function more than a placeholder.

This was written in C# and included in the submission is a .zip containing the source files along with
a executable that when opened will display the interactive interface of Digikey.
